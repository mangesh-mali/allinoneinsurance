            <h2 style="color:#002E5B;">What is Family Life Insurance?</h2> <br>
            <p>A family life insurance plan is a kind of medical insurance that covers all your family members in a
                single health insurance policy. Under this plan, a fixed sum insured is shared by all family members
                with an assumption that not everyone will get sick at the same time. Most family health insurance plans
                offer cashless hospitalization facilities, maternity benefits and cover pre & post hospitalization as
                well. </p>
